This is a canvas-based design tool. It allows you to draw shapes on a canvas, apply patterns to the shapes, zoom in and out, and pan around the canvas. You can also export your design.

To use the program, open the index.html file in your web browser. You can draw shapes by clicking and dragging on the canvas. To apply a pattern, release the mouse button. To zoom in and out, use the scroll wheel. To pan around the canvas, click and drag without drawing a shape.

To run the tests, use the command `npm run test` in your terminal.
