Build a web app using the following project description.
1. Platform:
a web app. This approach ensures that it remains client-side and doesnâ€™t need a backend unless you want to save user designs or provide other online functionalities.

2. UI/UX:
Have an intuitive user interface:

    Canvas Area: Central area where users can draw and design their templates.
    Shape Tools: Side menu with options such as rectangles, circles, ellipses, straight lines, curves, and custom shapes.
    Zoom and Pan: To allow detailed work on designs.
    Grid System: Helps users align and measure accurately.

3. Core Features:

    Shape Creation: Users should be able to select a tool, click and drag to create a shape, and modify it.
    Curve Customization: Provide Bezier handles or similar functionality to modify curves to the desired shape.
    Measurement Tools: A ruler or similar interface element, along with options to input exact dimensions.
    Multiple Page Indicator: If a design spans more than one page, have dashed lines or markers indicating where pages should be joined.
    Export/Print: Option to export the design as a PDF or directly print. Ensure correct scaling, so measurements stay accurate when printed.

4. Technical Implementation:

    Frontend: You can use web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Libraries like paper.js or fabric.js are powerful for drawing and handling graphics on the web.
    Responsive Design: Ensure the app works on both mobile and desktop. Use responsive frameworks like Bootstrap or Materialize.
    Exporting: To generate PDFs, you can use JavaScript libraries such as jsPDF.

5. Accuracy and Calibration:

    Scaling: It's crucial that when a design is printed, it remains true to scale. Embed a calibration feature where users can print a test ruler or shape to check if it measures correctly with physical tools.
    Units: Allow users to switch between metric and imperial units.

6. Testing:

    Usability Testing: Ensure that your target audience can intuitively use the app.
    Printing Tests: Regularly print designs to ensure accuracy. Test on different printers and paper sizes.

7. Optional Features:

    Template Library: Include a library of common woodworking or leatherworking patterns.
    Save and Load: While you want it to stay client-side, consider using the browser's local storage to let users save and load designs without needing an online account.

8. Launch & Feedback:

    Beta Testing: Release a beta version to a group of woodworkers or leatherworkers. Gather feedback and iterate.
    Continuous Improvements: Post-launch, continue collecting user feedback, and regularly update the app with improvements and new features.
    1. Stitch/Punch Indication Feature:

    Tool Selection: Add a 'Stitch/Punch' tool in the tool palette. Once selected, the user can choose between different types of stitch patterns or punch indications.

    Auto-Generate Along Edges: When the user selects a shape or a line, provide an option to "Add Stitches/Punches". Once clicked, the app should automatically space and place stitch or punch markers along the chosen edge.

    Custom Spacing: Allow users to specify the distance between stitch points or punches, accommodating various stitch styles and tools.

2. Customizable Patterns:

    Pattern Library: Provide a set of predefined stitch/punch patterns that users can choose from. These can be simple dots for stitches or more complex patterns indicating specific leatherworking tools.

    Custom Pattern Creation: Advanced users may wish to create their own stitch or punch patterns. Allow for a custom pattern creation tool where users can design a small segment of a pattern, which can then be repeated along the selected edges.

3. Edge Detection:

If users are drawing custom shapes or combining multiple shapes, the app should provide intelligent edge detection. This will help in accurately placing stitch/punch patterns without overlap or under-utilization.

    You can leverage libraries and algorithms that cater to edge detection to facilitate this.

4. Visual Indicators & Details:

    Hover Preview: Before finalizing the placement of stitches/punches, give a preview of how it'll look when the user hovers over the option.

    Custom Colors: Allow users to change the color of stitch/punch markers for better visibility against certain template colors.

    Measurement Indicators: Next to the stitch or punch markers, optionally display the distance to the next point. This will help users when manually sewing or punching, ensuring even spacing.

5. Tutorials & Guidance:

Given that this feature adds complexity to the app, consider integrating tutorials or step-by-step guides. A quick walkthrough can show users how to effectively use the stitch/punch tool, ensuring they get the most out of your app.

6. Feedback Loop:

Especially for this feature, gather feedback from actual leatherworkers. They'll provide insights into common stitching/punching patterns, distances, and preferences, helping refine this tool to be as useful as possible.
