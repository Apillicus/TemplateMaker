To implement the requested functionality, we will need to create several JavaScript modules, each responsible for a specific feature (zooming, panning, grid drawing, shape drawing, pattern application, etc.). We will also need to create event handlers to manage user interactions, extend the canvas initialization to handle window resizes, build out the exporting functionality, add actual test cases in Jest test suites, and add more advanced error handling and UI feedback.

Let's start with the entry point file:

src/index.js
